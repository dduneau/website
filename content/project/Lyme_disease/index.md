title: Lyme disease in seabirds
summary: Lyme disease is a major threat in many countries. The bacteria responsible for it is mainly transmitted by ticks feeding on mammals. We studied the role of seabirds as reservoir.

I completed my second year of master's degree under the supervision of Karen McCoy (MIVEGEC, Montpellier) and studied the impact of the specialization of tick vectors  on the specialization of borrelia, the bacterium responsible for  Lyme disease. 

This experience allowed me to do field work (2 months in the North of Norway including 1 month on the island of Hornoya), to familiarize myself with wet lab as well as with  phylogenetic analyses (Maximum likelihood) and molecular variance (AMOVA). 

In this study we show that host seabirds are reservoirs of a great diversity of borrelia (Duneau et al., 2008)[Duneau_IGE_2008.pdf] and we apply a method to correctly quantify the prevalence of borrelia in tick vectors (Gómez-Díaz et al., 2010)[GomezDiaz_EvolApp_2010.pdf]. This study was probably the embryo of my idea that differences within the same host species (here tick races, but then sexes) can have a very strong influence on the specialization of parasites.
