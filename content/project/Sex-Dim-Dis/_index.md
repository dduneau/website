Research on the <i>Daphnia</i> model has almost always been done in females. This is due to the fact that in most natural conditions the populations are overwhelmingly female. Realising that most of my males in the laboratory were being thrown down the drain when the state of knowledge of their biology was very limited, I wondered what role sexual dimorphism might play in the evolution of host-parasite relationships. This reflection first gave rise to an essay in which I proposed that a parasite is all the more likely to adapt to the sex it encounters the more frequently that, on the one hand, its encounters with the other sex are rare and, on the other hand, the differences between the sexes are great (Duneau and Ebert, 2012). In this article, I list a number of conditions under which parasites can be expected to adapt to one sex of their host. I argue on the basis of examples that the gender differences in symptoms and prevalence described for many parasites are partly explained by the properties of the parasite and not only, as is commonly claimed, by those of the host.
