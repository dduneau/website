During my thesis (06/2007-09/2011) at the University of Basel, Switzerland, under the supervision of Dieter Ebert, I was able to work on the interaction between the crustacean host Daphnia magna and one of its natural parasites, the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa â€“ an important ecological model to study co-evolution. 
Specifically, 
<ul>
  <li>I developed a method to determine the susceptibility or resistance of a Daphnia genotype to a P. ramosa genotype, </li>
  <li>I described the stages of infection and thus the parameters that affect them,</li>
  <li>which allowed me to discover the stage of infection explaining the cycles of coevolution in this system.</li>
</ul>

Considering the steps in a relatively simple way, Claude Combes says in his book "Parasitism : The Ecology and Evolution of Intimate Interactions" (1995) that steps in infections can serve as filters that shape host-parasite interactions. In the system of interaction between <i>Daphnia magna</i> and <i>Pasteuria ramosa</i>, previous results suggested that the step at which the parasite must meet its host is crucial and that host behaviour may affect the chances of infection [Decaestecker et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.082543099).

In order to determine the steps that followed this encounter (i.e. activation of the bacterial spore, attachment to the host, proliferation and transmission) and to determine their role in the interaction between the two protagonists, I developed a simple and effective method that is currently used routinely in Dieter Ebert's laboratory. This method allowed me to first explain that the effect of genotype-genotype interaction on infection success could be completely explained by differences  in the probability of attachment of the bacterium to the esophagus of its host, thus revealing the basis of the coevolution between <i>D. magna</i> and  <i>P. ramosa</i> [Duneau et al., 2011](Duneau_BMCBiol_2011.pdf). Neither host density nor sex affected the probability of activation and attachment. Taking into account  each individual step made it possible to reconcile theoretical models studying genotype x genotype interaction [Luijckx et al., 2012](Luijckx_Heredity_2012.pdf) and [Luijckx et al., 2013](Luijckx_CurBiol_2013.pdf).

Some Pasteuria genotypes were able to infect the host without attaching to the oesophagous. Before the end of my PhD, I found that those genotypes were able to go through the gut and attach to the hindgut before being released. In collaboration with Gilberto Bento and [Peter Field](http://www.peterdfields.com/), we showed that this alternative strategy had a different genetic basis and opened a whole area of research [Bento et al. 2020](Bento_Heredity_2020.pdf).

Using this method and reasoning, we showed that the different resistance alleles in the host had diverged for several million years, making it the oldest polymorphism described in animals to our knowledge. We also established that bacteria evolving in a population of <i>Daphnia magna</i> could attach to the esophagus of <i>Daphnia pulex</i>, a host in which they had not evolved, but were only able to proliferate in <i>Daphnia magna</i>. We have thus demonstrated that specialization for the host species is specifically at the level of the proliferation stage [Luijckx et al., 2014](Luijckx_Evolution_2014.pdf).

We then showed that the cuticle that covers the esophagus on which the bacteria attach carries with it, at the time of molting, the bacteria that had not yet penetrated the host. In fact, we have shown experimentally that individuals who molt within 12 hours after attachment of the bacterium can avoid being infected. Thus, we have shown for the first time that molting, a process generally considered a phase of weakness, can also  prevent infections. However, this mechanism seems too constrained by development to be induced [Duneau and Ebert, Proc. B, 2012](Duneau_ProcB_2012.pdf). This work has aroused the interest of the media (e.g. [Le Figaro](https://bit.ly/2tbIPUk) & [Live Science](https://bit.ly/37aT6Po)) .
