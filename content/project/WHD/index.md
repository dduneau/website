title: Within-host dynamics and disease outcomes
summary: Infection outcome depends on the success of the parasite within its host. With theoretical and empirical approaches, we study what influences pathogen dynamics and its implication on symptoms.

Within a sick host population, individuals are not equal in the face of illness. This variation, which sometimes results in host survival or death, is present even when controlling for host genetics and environment. We have studied the role of the proliferation in the variation in disease outcome. By monitoring bacterial populations over time within hosts of the same population and using modelling tools ("mixture models"), we were first able to describe the phases of proliferation and propose measures to characterise it. 
* Bacterial Load Upon Death (BLUD)
* Set-Point Bacterial Load (SPBL)

By modifying the immune characteristics of the host, we were able to determine the relative roles of the host and the parasite in these phases and we established that the variation in the probability of survival depends on the variation in a key parameter of the infectious process: the time that the hosts take to control bacterial proliferation. A difference of a few hours in this control time can make the difference between survival and death.
