To increase their transmission, parasites can manipulate their host. Such example of extended phenotype provide some of the most extraordinary story in biology. 
<h3>I have worked on two of them:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Trematode - Gammarus - bird </li>
  <li>Nematomorpha - cricket</li>
</ul>  

The nematomorpha larvae first live in aquatic larva of insects. When the adult insect flies away, it leaves the water with this hairworm which is still a larvae. When it dies, crickets can get infected by feeding on the decaying corps. Then the hairworm start to grow within its cricket host. However, when it get matture, the male or the female hairworm needs to go back to a water body in order to find mates and reproduce in a structure called Gordian knots.
