I seek to understand why individuals within a given species respond differently to environmental challenges, especially those coming from parasitic organisms. To study this, I apply concepts from evolutionary biology to model invertebrate systems (e.g., Drosophila melanogaster, Daphnia magna). Fundamentally, my approach is empirical; however, I also deploy tools from functional genetics, genomics, and transcriptomics.
