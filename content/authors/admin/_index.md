Why do some individuals suffer more than others from infection?  

I seek to understand why individuals within a given species respond differently to environmental challenges, especially from parasitic organisms and more recently plastic pollution. I apply concepts from evolutionary biology to model invertebrates (e.g., <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) and human, and combine empirical approaches such as controlled infections and functional genetics with statistical modelling, genomics (GWAS), and transcriptomics (scRNA seq)to study the role of host, and parasite, evolution in this variation in disease outcome.
