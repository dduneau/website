abstract: In the <i>Daphnia magna–Pasteuria ramosa</i> host–parasite system, the most important step of the infection process is the one in which <i>P. ramosa</i> spores attach to the host’s foregut. Here we describe a new parasite genotype, which, unlike previously studied genotypes, attaches to the host’s hindgut, not to its foregut. Host resistance shows great diversity across natural populations. Using a QTL approach, we detected one QTL that co-localizes with the previously described locus of resistance to foregut attachment, and a second, major QTL located in an unlinked genomic region. We find no evidence of epistasis. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: To understand the mechanisms of antagonistic coevolution, it is crucial to identify the genetics of parasite resistance. Using QTL approach, we discovered a second <i>P. ramosa</i> attachment site and a novel host-resistance locus, with implications for both for the coevolutionary dynamics (e.g., Red Queen and the role of recombination), and for the evolution and epidemiology of the infection process.
