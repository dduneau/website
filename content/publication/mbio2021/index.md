abstract: During an infection, parasites face a succession of challenges, each decisive for disease outcome. The diversity of challenges requires a series of parasite adaptations to successfully multiply and transmit from host to host. Thus, the pathogen genotypes which succeed during one step might be counter-selected in later stages of the infection. Using the bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila and adult Drosophila melanogaster as hosts, we showed that such step-specific adaptations, here linked to GASP (i.e. Growth Advantage in Stationary Phase) mutations in the X. nematophila master gene regulator lrp, exist and can trade-off with each other. We found that nonsense lrp mutations had lowered ability to resist the host immune response, while all classes of mutations in lrp were associated with a decrease in the ability to proliferate during early infection. We demonstrate that reduced proliferation of X. nematophila best explains diminished virulence in this infection model. Finally, decreased proliferation during the first step of infection is accompanied with improved proliferation during late infection, suggesting a trade-off between the adaptations to each step. Step specific adaptations could play a crucial role in the chronic phase of infections in any diseases that show similar small colony variants (also known as SCV) to X. nematophila.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Within host evolution has been described in many bacterial diseases, and the genetic basis behind the adaptations stimulated a lot of interest. Yet, the studied adaptations are generally focused on antibiotic resistance, rarely on the adaptation to the environment given by the host, and the potential trade-off hindering adaptations to each step of the infection are rarely considered. Those trade-offs are key to understand intra-host evolution, and thus the dynamics of the infection. However, the understanding of these trade-offs supposes a detailed study of host-pathogen interactions at each step of the infection process, with for each step an adapted methodology. Using Drosophila melanogaster as host and the bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila, we investigated the bacterial adaptations resulting from GASP mutations known to induce small colony variant (SCV) phenotype positively selected within-the-host over the course of an infection, and the trade-off between step specific adaptations.
