abstract: A central problem in infection biology is understanding why two individuals exposed to identical infections have different outcomes. We have developed an experimental model where genetically identical, co-housed Drosophila given identical systemic infections experience different outcomes, with some individuals succumbing to acute infection while others control the pathogen as an asymptomatic persistent infection. We found that differences in bacterial burden at the time of death did not explain the two outcomes of infection. Inter-individual variation in survival stems from variation in within-host bacterial growth, which is determined by the immune response. We developed a model that captures bacterial growth dynamics and identifies key factors that predict the infection outcome: the rate of bacterial proliferation and the time required for the host to establish an effective immunological control. Our results provide a framework for studying the individual host-pathogen parameters governing the progression of infection and lead ultimately to life or death.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A central problem with biomedicine is to understand why two individuals exposed to seemingly identical infections may have radically different clinical outcomes. Using the Drosophila melanogaster model, we analyse in depth, both through functional genetics and mathematical modeling, the main determinants that underlie the stochastic outcome of infection. First, we show that even in the absence of genetic variance and controlled environment some hosts survive infection when others succumb to it. Second, we have identified two new measures of bacterial loads (Bacterial Load Upon Death and load during chronicity) to describe the infectious process. Third, we have shown that host survival is predicted by bacterial proliferation within the host, and we have shown that small variations in the host's innate immune response make the difference between surviving hosts and dying hosts. Fourth, we have developed an integrative and dynamic model of infection. Our model accurately predicts the outcome of infection for hosts and shows that the moment when the immune response initiates the control of bacterial growth determines the outcome of infection. Our paper presents a detailed study of the key parameters that control infection dynamics and generate a seemingly stochastic interindividual variation in host survival. This article fits into my desire to understand the role of the stages of infection in the evolution of host-parasite relationships, but the steps/phases described here are those during intra-host proliferation.
