abstract: A central problem in infection biology is understanding why two individuals exposed to identical infections have different outcomes. We have developed an experimental model where genetically identical, co-housed Drosophila given identical systemic infections experience different outcomes, with some individuals succumbing to acute infection while others control the pathogen as an asymptomatic persistent infection. We found that differences in bacterial burden at the time of death did not explain the two outcomes of infection. We found that differences in bacterial burden at the time of death did not explain the two outcomes of infection. Inter-individual variation in survival stems from variation in within-host bacterial growth, which is determined by the immune response. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this "essay" we propose for the first time the idea that the sexual dimorphism of diseases may be the result of the specific adaptation of parasites to the sex of their host. Similarly, as organisms adapt to the environment to which they are most frequently exposed, parasites can adapt to the sex they encounter most frequently (e.g., either because males and females are exposed differently, or because one sex is more easily infected than another due to immune differences). As a result, parasites behave differently depending on the sex they infect.
