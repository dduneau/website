abstract: The existence of immunological memory in invertebrates remains a contentious topic. Using clonal hosts and parasites, we tested whether initial exposure of the host to the parasite (priming), followed by clearing of the parasite with antibiotic, protects the host from a second exposure (challenge). Our experiments included three treatments: priming and challenge with the same or with a different parasite clone, or no priming. Our results show that the likelihood of infection and the degree of parasite proliferation did not differ between treatments, supporting the conclusion that there is no immunological memory in this system.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We tested immune priming in <i>Daphnia<i> and our results support the conclusion that there is no immunological memory in to <i>Pasteuria ramosa</i> infections.
