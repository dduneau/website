abstract: The influence of host and parasite genetic background on infection outcome is a topic of great interest because of its pertinence to theoretical issues in evolutionary biology. In the present study, we use a classical genetics approach to examine the mode of inheritance of infection outcome in the crustacean Daphnia magna when exposed to the bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. In contrast to previous studies in this system, we use a clone of P. ramosa, not field isolates, which allows for a more definitive interpretation of results. We test parental, F1, F2, backcross and selfed parental clones (total 284 genotypes) for susceptibility against a clone of P. ramosa using two different methods, infection trials and the recently developed attachment test. We find that D. magna clones reliably exhibit either complete resistance or complete susceptibility to P. ramosa clone C1 and that resistance is dominant, and inherited in a pattern consistent with Mendelian segregation of a single-locus with two alleles. The finding of a single host locus controlling susceptibility to P. ramosa suggests that the previously observed genotype–genotype interactions in this system have a simple genetic basis. This has important implications for the outcome of host–parasite coevolution. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that resistance to parasites in invertebrates is mostly coded by one or few loci with dominance. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We use a classical genetics approach to examine the mode of inheritance of infection outcome in the crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i> when exposed to the bacterial parasite <i>Pasteuria ramosa<i>. We find host genotypes were either completely resistance or completely susceptibility to given parasite genotypes, that resistance is dominant, and inherited in a pattern consistent with Mendelian segregation of a single-locus with two alleles.
