abstract: In species with separate sexes, parasite prevalence and disease expression is often different between males and females. This effect has mainly been attributed to sex differences in host traits, such as immune response. Here, we make the case for how properties of the parasites themselves can also matter. Specifically, we suggest that differences between host sexes in many different traits, such as morphology and hormone levels, can impose selection on parasites. This selection can eventually lead to parasite adaptations specific to the host sex more commonly encountered, or to differential expression of parasite traits depending on which host sex they find themselves in. Parasites adapted to the sex of the host in this way can contribute to differences between males and females in disease prevalence and expression. Considering those possibilities can help shed light on hostâ€“parasite interactions, and impact epidemiological and medical science.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this "essay" we propose for the first time the idea that the sexual dimorphism of diseases may be the result of the specific adaptation of parasites to the sex of their host. Similarly, as organisms adapt to the environment to which they are most frequently exposed, parasites can adapt to the sex they encounter most frequently (e.g., either because males and females are exposed differently, or because one sex is more easily infected than another due to immune differences). As a result, parasites behave differently depending on the sex they infect.
